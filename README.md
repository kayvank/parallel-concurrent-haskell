Workbook for Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell
==
My study workbook for the [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](https://simonmar.github.io/pages/pcph.html)

## What is this
Some chapter exercises of the book. Each chapter is a subproject, see [cabal.project](./cabal.project)

## Way do this
Reading and doing the code helps me understand better

## How to use it
There are currently not tests, but you can execute each chapter:

``` sh
cabal run c07
```

### TODO
+ Add tests
